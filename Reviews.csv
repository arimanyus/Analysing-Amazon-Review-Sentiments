  Price is too high for this specifications. 11000-12000 is the perfect price. Other than everything is fine
"  Reliable phone with neat experience. Zero bloatware.Even though it's a 12 MP cam, the quality of photos and top notch.Battery keeps us for 2 days as well - good software optimization.The build quality is a good as the ones in 25k+ prices for other phones.Perfect everyday use phone!"

Strictly speaking, you will be more than happy with the performance of this phone if you are average user (not a heavy mobile gamer).This phone is great for daily use and Nokia could have added few extra features. Overall this is a beautiful phone for this price range and one shouldn't expect too much.Go for it, you'll be happy.Note: Charger is ""Made in China"""
"  Some people think that this phone maybe overpriced. But I have to say it is one of the best phone of this price. I buy this phone for moderate use, not for gaming. The camera of this phone is really  & the audio quality & battary perfect & in-hand fill are great. Nokia is not like other chiniese brands who have a lote of privacy issue . It give you a stock Android with zero bloatware, that give you a good experience for use. Nokia give 3 years security update & 2 years android update."
"  Really love the design and build quality of Nokia products.Nokia 5.3 is a beautiful Android one device, hence zero bloatware. Great Camera, Big screen, Smooth performance, Solid build quality. What more can one ask for."
"  Since most of you would already know about the kinda average specs. Here are my impressions of using the phone:> Built feels good, the plastic back panel doesn't feel cheap at all and the buttons are very tactile. The notification light is placed on the power button, which is hard to notice. The back panel has a fine texture, but it doesn't feel or give any extra grip, but the curved edges help in holding the phone better.> Display resolution is not right for the price and screen size. It's 720p+ on a massive 6.5inch screen. There is no outright pixelation, but if you have seen 1080p screens before you would notice that the text and icons are not sharp enough. If you used a 720p phone before then this display would be okayish. Other than that the 20:9 ratio makes the display quite tall. Brightness is decent.> Stock Android experience: Probably the main selling point of Nokia would be the clean Android OS it offers. There are no additional apps installed in the phone, except for some basic Google apps. Even you can choose not to install some Google apps like Duo, Google News, Google Play Music etc during the setup.Some may not like this as most other brands pre-install some social media and utility apps like voice recorders.The phone is upto date with security patches till August 2020 on 5 Sept 2020, which is nice. The optimizations are good and regular apps like social media, browsing and video playback work fine. I don't game, so idea about that.There is 2 year software update guaranteed as a part of the Android One programme.> Battery life: It's excellent, phone is well optimized for battery life. In my two days of use with 4G data on always, the battery lasted very well. I got 2.5 to 3 hrs screen-on-time for every 25% of the battery on regular use. But no inclusion of fast-charging is quite disappointing.> Cameras: Haven't tested much, but GCam seems to work better as seen from some reviews. Will update this later.> Confused hardware: There is NFC (probably because the phone was for European markets) but no information on a Gyro sensor. Though there is a compass, which some say is not available.Other than that you get a clear case and headphones in the box, like most other Nokia phones.Overall, if you want to buy a stock android based phone or cannot wait for flash sales, then the Nokia 5.3 is good."
"  After using for two days , I say that a wonderful product designed and developed by nokia, little dissatisfied with the size of the phone, little bigger on size, I've been a fan of nokia since windows Phone, already using 6.1, 6.1 plus and this one is the latest addition in arsenal, the greatest thing is software updates from android one and nokia living upto it's promise. Had no issues with any of nokia phones till date like heating, lag. Zero bloatware and a pure android experience which makes it a wonderful experience to enjoy the phone. Basically I am an iphone user earlier, but after using nokia 3 which is my very first phone after nokia launched in Android, since then I have shifted to nokia completely. A wonderful brand one can rely on."
"  Just Ordered.Waiting for the phone.Feel quite overpriced,but I am sure this phone lasts more than 3 years without any single issues which other phones don't,in this segment"

"  Mobile looks very nice,but performance is very bad.Battery drain 100 to 10% only in 4hour and using only of fb. Mobile got hand in every 1minute. Over heat if you using multiple aap at the same time. As per Specifications, the cost was little high. I am using all brands mobile, but 8k mobile also better then this.I was pleased return request but Amazon service is very poor they not responding. And courier service also not give the this product to door step. If you don't wast your money then go with other mobile."
"  Bought this phone yesterday. Writing a review,Pros:1. Light weight for 6.5 inch screen size2. Excellent build quality3. Stock android one with all the latest and greatest features4. I bought the 6 GB variance, and you can feel the multitasking works smoothly5. Face unlock and finger print unlock works well6. Color scheme and HD+ display suffices the screen. I was using one plus 6T, find very less differenceCons:1. Fast charging unavailable, however charging is decent2. I added 64 GB SD card additionally and it uses it as a portable device onlyI think at this price point, this is the best available phone with future promised and most importantly its made in India and non-Chinese brand."
"  I am using now from last 2-3 days. Average phone with  high price tagNokia still long way to catch up with market trend or other mobile in this price range.Simple phone no special features in term accessibility like taking screen shot, launching camera, torch, DND mode,  or navigation.Battery 4000Mah but does not last for more than a day with normal usage.i feel price should be around 10k for product and features."
"  Nice product in this price range, have used it for 4 days only presently, but found the battery backup to be good, runs for around 1 and 1/2 days, depending on usage. Camera quality good. Light weight, audio is good. Shuffling between apps is smooth and easy. Though there is 64 GB internal memory, most of it will get occupied by the apps and their updates it seems. Will require SD card for expansion of memory in the long run. Gaming was not a priority, so can't comment on how it works when playing games. Otherwise definitely value for money, and of course, 'Nokia', name says it all."
  So finally our Nokia arrived to take on other Chinese products.  I’m so glad it came back.  I’m using this phone it just works.  Thank you Nokia
"  Pros:1. Smooth Software Experience.2. Multi User support, on my Poco f1 I could not have two users. One user I use for personal and other for work.3. Good display.4. Excellent battery life.5. Excellent Software update support. It will receive Android 12 and 3 years of security updates.6. No bloatware.7. For light gaming and day to day video usage is butter smooth.8. No heating.9. Software is optimized very well and Qualcomm 665 provides butter smooth experience.10. Much better than any phone between 10k and 15k.Cons:Decen camera."
"  Fresh off using Samsung galaxy M30s, shifted to Nokia 5.3.Right off the bat, this one is bit expensive if you compare with Samsung products, way expensive if you go for other Chinese brands for the specs it's packing.That being said it didn't fail me so far, very good slick design (M30s felt bulky and heavy), good performance (I don't play games so I'm good),  pure stock Android with 2 yr updates so that's a win( I hate it when my phone asks me to install or installs apps that I don't want)4000mah battery does last for atleast 1.5 days on normal use. I was watching YouTube for 2 hrs that discharged battery about 20% So I guess full charge will give you about 10hrs playback. No fast charging could be issue for some. There was a bit heating issue while charging, not exactly buring sensation though.Cameras I don't use much so won't comment on that.One thing did bug me though, it's display. I usually keep brightness at 0% even in dark mode. With M30s and Moto G4 (secondary phone) I don't face brightness issues. Here with 5.3 first time I have to increase brightness.Overall It's a good phone. I look for mid range professional looking phones for long term use. Nokia checks all the boxes.For others who go for photos, games or higher specs it may not be for you."
"  Instead of going to Chinese brand we can choose this ... battery is really good... Charging time not too slow...2hrs for full charge,, camera is nice if u Google GCam then it's awesome...stock android no bloatware...upto 3years u wil get updates with our miss...720p screen looks like 1080p screen present in redmi phone...cz of higher nits screen quality is really good...if u want mobile for atleast 2-3years with out any issues u can choose this mobile ...."
"  Camera is average (good in daylight, but poor performance in low light).Charging time is too long maybe due to 10 W charger and more over phone is getting heated up while charging.Notification light is not working on app notifications (except while charging) still after various setting changes."
"  Was a Nokia fan during my education years. Then we saw the industry switch and then Nokia coming back with android OS.Wanted to give it a try for old time sake. Well the phone doesn't come close to any of the expectations. My foremost expectation was smooth operation of the phone while using basic operations like browsing internet, switching between tabs (I'm not into gaming or using high performance demanding apps on phone), but this phone has unexpected laga very frequently. And sometimes it freezes for no reason. One more pathetic issue is that when you dial a number a the screen goes black for some time. No matter what you do it won't be active. Just imagine the call processing happening in the background and you are helpless if it was mistakenly called or you want to switch on speaker phone and move to some other tab.I think this is the reason that they only have replacement option and not return. That too window is for 7 days. Seems like a thought through way around. You may have once sold this pathetic phone to me, but I would never ever buy a Nokia phone now. Probably this childhood love needed a heartbreak to come out of the fondness zone of Nokia.One more thing, I was ready to buy another phone by exchanging this within a week's time. But this model doesn't even show up on the exchange phone list. All the edge cases are also covered. Haha.Will probably use this for an year if I don't end up smashing it against the wall for it out of no where screen freezes. Awaiting Good Riddance."
"  An elegant phone. For people who don't mind spending a few extra bucks on time-tested, solid brands. Nokia might not have been on the popularity charts for quite some time, but I decided to go for this phone after reading the reviews, and because I'd been using the Xperia R1 Plus for the past two years and needed a change. I am delighted to have chosen the Nokia 5.3, to last me for the next 3 years at least! The display, camera and battery backup are all decent. The 6 GB of RAM helps the phone run super-smooth. What I found most impressive is that the swipe gesture from the bottom of the screen conveniently exits you from any app and takes you to the home screen, or displays your apps running in the background depending on your swipe motion. Also, swiping inwards from anywhere on the side edges takes you to the previous page, which in most phones can be done only using the back button at the bottom of the screen. Dark theme can be selected easily in the display settings and it makes the phone so much more easier to use for weary eyes.The Nokia 5.3's build quality and design is awesome and reminds you of back in the day when Nokia phones used to be everything. I didn't mind paying 3-4K extra for the same specifications that other second-rate phones available in the market in the range of 11K provide, because I know that the sturdiness and delight of using the Nokia will, in the long run, factor out any premium I've paid for acquiring the device. I would highly recommend the Nokia 5.3 to users who rely on their phones for 9-10 hours of work in a day, 2-3 hours of leisure and the rest to battery-power conservation!"
"  It's a simple and solid device. Android one is refreshing without the pre installed and nonsense apps.The device and camera works good. Maybe a little underwhelming, but does its job.Android's gesture control is also intuitive once you get the hang of it.Overall, a respectable non Chinese alternative at this price range."
"  Better try from Nokia to give this Android model. I'm giving my review after 4days of usage. Phone quality is really good, camera is nice. Weight is very less.It will be good if they still concentrate on user interface side. Yes, it is collaboration of windows+Android. Gallery and themes are missing, Girls will really miss those items."
  I did not see the spec of main processor/ram/storage  etc.. All i wanted was a phone to use confidently for the next 3 years with regular software update.Confident of Nokia fulfilling its commitment.
  This mobile has no features whatsoever. You are living in ultra HD age and this mobile is still living in 720+. No sound output in earphone mode. Trusted Nokia but now I realised why Nokia has lost its market. No Joy of having this mobile.
  14k and HD+ display
  Phone is good.. overall but not a value for money.Battery life.Just a normal battery.. used just 2 days and it barely made 1 day.CameraIt is fine.. not the best.. but good for day to day life.ProcessorOkay processor.. not ideal for high graphic gamesNot many features.. just have basic features.It should have been a 13000 phone for 6 gb varient.Only best thing is the uodates android one.. and a non Chinese phone.And the seal of the phone was broken.
"  Received yesterday, used continuous for 3 hrs no heating issue. Battery is decent. Charger is 10W but is decent, you have 4k battery and no need to charge again and again. Camera is decent too, if you are Pro photographer, wait for Pixel 4a. Snapdragon 665 is enough for this phone. Receive 3 security patches within12 hrs.  But it should have 1080 display being 6.5 inch screen."
  First of all I've been using this a really great phone for 3 days and these are my takes:pros:1.great build quality for a plastic phone2.pure android experience with august security update ready3.decent main camera and good processing.4.performance totally cool for day to day tasks(i dont play games on phone )5.bright screen.6.speaker is loud and decentcons:1.low resolution display(fine print fonts gets pixelated)2.screen is larger beyond comfortable size3.battery average (with 7hrs screen time leaves 30% left)4.telephoto and macro camera utter rubbish.5.side button placements are too high given the phone is larger uncomfortably large.It's a fairly great phone if you want to avoid Chinese manufacturers like me. For optimum camera experience download gcam mod.
"  I was very excited to buy this phone since Nokia was my favourite brand once. But once I unboxed the phone, all my hopes were shattered. I am not coming to the specifications at all, since there are many experts here who can give a better review of the same.I just want to highlight how user unfriendly the phone or rather the stock android is. I don't know whether it is a problem of Android one or the phone itself, but the fingerprint sensor is pathetic. It has taken 5 fingerprints of both my index fingers but the phone never opens with a single touch. After repeated 5-6 attempts, finally if it desires then it opens.You cannot silent/vibrate/put on sound mode from notification panel. Yes it is so.The autoroatate feature is disgusting. Most of the times the phone will rotate in opposite direction of my viewing angle when I turn this on.Wifi receiving capability of the phone is very poor.Since it is stock android, there are hardly any good customizations.I had to search the hell through to find a music player and then I found out YT Music the saviour. Seriously, the phone doesn't have an in-built music player.And one more thing, you will have to search in google how to bring the back button in this phone :-PFinally, the verdict. Please don't buy this mobile. I desperately want to get rid of this ASAP. For me as of now, Realme is the saviour. Nokia you betrayed me."
  Price is to high . In this price we get full hd display this mobile has hd display and processer is too old 665 battery only 4000...
  Don't. Buy this product. Behaves abnormal. Google assistant frequently opens up so irritating. Calling somebody and suddenly speakerphone will automatically starts. Hanging problems have to restart almost 3 to 4 times a day. Finger sensor is just horrible you have to press it hard to be able to unlock screen. Sad story overall regret that I bought this phone.
"  I probably got a defective piece . the mobile suddenly stopped working after 10 days of use contacted amazon but got no proper solution from them, also I cannot replace the item now , because the window was open till 18 the of sept . my mobile suddenly stopped working, the screen went blank even though it had around 42%of charge left. It feels so bad that Nokia is not keeping up the quality it is known for. Now I have no other option but to visit the service center to get it checked, tried both hard and soft reset, but the phone is dead, I think I made a wrong decision by taking in account of the quality  Nokia brand is known for. I had been a Nokia user but sadly I think present Nokia is keeping up the quality, feeling sad that just 10 days of usage and brand new phone is dead , quality is compromised !! Now I can't get a exchange, no help from amazon nor from Nokia !!"
  If you're into stock android without any bloatware or constant Ads running in your background then this phone is for you. Phone is fast and responsive for daily use and with good built.
"  Just a Budget Phone, Average looks and average performance.For most of us one hand operation would be difficult with 6.65 inches screen!! Ladies and gentlemen it is not practical to use it with one hand!!!! This is the biggest drawback!!Average old style display!!! You get a really old feeling after using this.Nokia (HMD) you need to do better!!!  Bought this only due to current India Sentiment!!! Not worth the price!!!"
  Not much complain about the price of the phone. The 13 MP primary camera is better than most of over hyped MP of other brand phones. Battery life is great when not treated extensively with high end games.The phone's clean UI experience and with 2 years of android update and 3 years of security update worth the price. Also with brand like NOKIA you get the best build quality and looks.

"  Don't expect much but yes, at this price phone is quite cool and looks beautiful with this new design. Performance is also upto the mark. Thumbs up from my side."
"  My Previous Review was rejected. So, I am writing again straightforward :-PROS -1) Android One - This is the reason I bought this phone. It has lot of cons which I knew but still I bought it. Its cleaner and faster and in 15k budget, I will say its great.2) Build Quality - As expected from Nokia, It has good build quality and doesn't look cheap at all.CONS -1) Display - Just ok. I can see big pixels easily. Just tilt phone a bit and you will see.2) Fingerprint - Slow and not accurate. It fails 3 times out of 10 at least for me. But its ok for the price. When we spent 15k on a budget device, we deserve this.3) Touch - May be with me. But I find touch not that responsive. Many times I have to swipe again to see notifications or app drawer. It was never the case with old phone4) Camera - Its good at day and horrible at night/low light but for 15k, I think its ok. That's my first low budget phoneEdit: 7th OctoberAfter using it for almost 3 weeks now.Fingerprint again: It fail 5 times out of 10 for me. I was using xperia XA1 plus before. There It hardly failed. May be 1 time out of 10. But In this nokia, situation is so bad that I am thinking to turn it off. I have removed fingerprint from whatsapp already.Connectivity: Many times wifi doesn't work. Other phones working fine. If I am using wifi while in call and then close it to switch to 4g, sometime it doesn't work. Jio and Airtel don't have connection speed in this phone. It was not an issue with Xperia XA1 plus. Sony phones are known to have bad connectivity but this Nokia did really poor. May be something wrong with phone? I will review for some more days and then make it 1 star if same issue persist."
"  I bought the device variant (6GB RAM, 64 GB Storage). As an Android Developer. I was interested in its Stock Android and guaranteed updates for 2 years.Pros:-1. Fast working, sufficient RAM, and storage space.2. Stock Android and guaranteed Android OS updates for 2 years. (good for developers only)3. NFC, Dual-Band Wifi, Good network connectivity, and good calling experience.4. Sepatare slots for SIM1, SIM2 and SD-Card. Also supports OTG with Type-C connector.5. Good Camera quality with 4k resolution, portrait and slow-motion supported (but not very good).6. Classic look with transparent back cover with Gorilla glass screen.7. No bloatwares or unwanted pre-installed apps.8. Very loud sound quality and Notification LED on power button.Cons:-1. Poor display resolution to watch youtube or camera taken pictures.2. Many required sensors absent. Gyroscopic-sensor missing which is mainly used in Google Maps for directions and precision.3. Lot of issues in software (like the screen goes off while calling many times and we are not able to cut the call).4. Very-Poor User-Experience in terms of look and graphics.5. Non-Fast charger inside the box (takes time to charge) and sometimes it heats up too even on normal charging.6. Battery of 4000mAH but lasts for less than 24 Hrs which is very less than expected.7. Over-priced. You can get the same device configurations in Rs.10K android phones too.Who should buy this device:-1. Developers who don't want to spend a lot of money on good stock android devices.2. Good for parents who want basic features with WhatsApp, FB, etc.Overall:- Good & Fast device but not for those who expect a good user experience from the device. Nokia lovers will also hate this device. Would recommend considering other devices too."
  Very very very worst mobile don't waste your money
"  The front camera is really bad on this phone. And Amazon denied the return for this product as they'd return only if the product is defected, damaged or different item received . Completely dissatisfied by Amazon's refund policy.Probably use other platforms to buy products going forward.Thanks"
"  after 3 weeks of usagePros1)Nokia(2 yr software update, 3 yr security update)2)Decent Snapdragon processor (665)3)Battery backup is good(for average use, small games and stream)4)Display looks good(HD+). my previous mob has HD resolution so I didn't feel bad.5)Front camera is superb, the rear camera is okay.Cons:1)mobile is heating while charging.2)Price is somewhat high compared to other brands.3)audio quality is bad and feel the speaker vibration when the volume is more than 50%."
  Not at all good .. I don't like this device value for money...if it is under 10k then it would be value for money. Don't buy this... Its charger als not fast charger .
"  I'm using this phone for the last 2 days. Battery is amazing it gives me almost 2 days backup. In daylight the camera is good, nice colour correction. But in night mode it is below average.I'm a mood gamer. For me snapdragon 665 is ok. But we can get more in this price.Best thing in this phone is stock android. No bloatware. Only google apps, if you want you can uninstall them.My verdict isIf you want to buy this phone for normal use then it is best choice. But if you want to use it for gaming purpose then it is not perfect for you."
  Would prefer phones to have removable battery and old fashion sim trays but this isn't how phones are made now I guess. It's better to buy this one than some chinki phone. Having a chinese phone used to make people a laughing stock and now their phones are like some weird status symbol. Anyway don't know what all those tech youtubers or as I like to say youtube home shopping channels are complaining about this phone. It is pretty solid. Go for it if this is your price range
"  The phone out of the box has issues with speaker and microphone. When the issue was raised with amazon.in, they arranged a technician's visit outside the return window and he wasn't able to resolve the issue. We continue to work with Amazon Customer Service to exchange my Nokia 5.3 for a working phone."
"  Firstly, I would say that my trust on Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. is reduced now than ever, as the phone's box was damaged, the corners were tore & the seller had applied a regular transparent sticky tape on it, and even the main phone seal was removed, so, the phone was definitely removed from the box earlier, before it was sold to us. Maybe it was a replacement unit, which was returned by someone & the seller just applied some sticky tape & sent it to us. Shame on you, Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.I immediately opened the box to see if the phone was damaged or scratched or something, & thankfully, it was not & is in good condition, so, I decided not to return it.Talking about the phone, the Nokia 5.3 comes with Android One program, with the Google's stock Android experience, which is the main reason I chose this over the other phones at the price range.Also the guaranteed 2 years Android updates & security patches every month, is what I like about this phone.The phone looks good, the back is glossy polycarbonate which looks just like glass & the Cyan color looks awesome.As it has stock Android, the performance is also great, the navigation is smooth & without any lag.The display even though it's not full HD, is clear, crisp & bright and the lesser pixels will help to improve the battery life, than it would have if it had a full HD display, so, the display is great.Battery is 4000 mAh, and stock Android's battery optimization & the Adaptive battery feature will help the overall battery life, so, that's good.The phone already got the latest monthly security patch after starting, so, it's a peace of mind to know that the updates are regular & will also get the major Android updates for the next 2 years.The main camera is decent & captures nice photos in bright light and the low-light performance is also okay. The photos from wide-angle camera looks soft & less detailed and the macro camera is just bad & I wouldn't have mind if it was not even there. But I'm glad the main camera's sensor is good enough to take photos & it's the main camera only which we use often.The Nokia 5.3 is a good budget Android One phone, at the price range (from not any Chinese brand) and I'm pretty satisfied with the overall experience of the phone."
"  Nokia 5.3 is fantastic smartphone ever. Great Features. Feel premium & cool. Looking Good. Awesome build quality. Nokia give you one Quality back cover & Headphone with phones , feel great. Most people says they have only 10 watt charger. So I would like to tell you , It's a fast charger than other 15 watt charger. 100% satisfied with this Best Smartphone. Thanks Amazone & Nokia."
  The most trusted brand. Don't have to worry about security n the Cyan color is awesome n it's the best built phone in the sub 20k segment
  Issue production it's 10days only n phone display is all pink n it's becoming blank slowly n slowly why ?sale defective item🤬please look into this matter other's have complaint the same i want my money back now!!can't fool innocent people like me
  Got this phone on 2nd September 2020. Phone worked for only 10 days. Display turned bright pink and then went blank. I am now left with an unusable dead phone. Very disappointed with Nokia.
"  This phone is for those who like a no nonsense device. The display, camera, battery are all reasonably good. The build is solid, and phone is compact to hold.I have been using Motorola for past 5 years. This phone feels like a step up. Comparison with cheaper Chinese brands are not fair, the experience with them is awful."
"  First of all i am not a hard core gamer, but i am a moderate gamer.Battery life:if moderately used upto 12 hrs of screen-on time, complete gaming then 4 to 5 hrscamera: decent one for the main one 13 MP(Pure colors), wide angle color saturation is not upto 13MP, 2MP  macro noise is there and depth shots are good.processing: No lag faced when using, smooth performance, i have received 3 security patches updates within 25  days. when playing games too. Performance wise good though it is older processor, but it has android  one.charging: It takes around 2 hrs to get full charge.speaker: there is some noise in the speaker when volume kept low, but not noticeable if you do not put your ears  in the speaker.But very loud speaker, when kept volume high.the googles AI makes some task easier.the google assistant is very easy to use with dedicated button and very responsive when called inbetween games or video chatting.It had fallen two times from 4 feet  and not a small damge though(with nokia protective case provided with the phone)screen is nice,the brightness is actually bright, you will not notice if it is 720p when using,The compass works too.overall nice and sturdy phone, the OS is good as it's adaptivity is good."
"  Using it for 4 days, speed is good in terms of ram, storage and processor as I'm not a gamer. Battery life showing good, in one day drains about 35-40%. Display is fair enough. Contains 4 cameras though I couldn't understand the use of the depth sensor one. A bit disappointing from the point of sound, without headphones somewhat okay but with headphones could have been much better. Used Nokia 5 before this, sound quality was superb. But overall good one."
  Great work by HMD globals...U have not compromised with the soul of Nokia brand....Everything is amazing...Camera quality is also very good but night mode not so goodHope I will receive regular security updates for 3 years for which I have given 14k...Overall good phone with great build quality...Come on HMD globals u can win the world...
  No Bloatware and regular security update & update in version having an edge
  Nokia has beaten all the other brands the colour feel performance gives you a premium feel.
"  Nokia rises again! Honest review after 2 months of usage.Android One, great battery life, decent display, no screen lag, good audio, great multitasking, good design and colors, great hold and feel, decent camera (front and rear) - daylight shots are great, night mode, lowlight rendering are good enough, portrait mode selfies come out well. Expected at this price range. It's got plenty of neat features for business users like me.Cons: Nothing that's a deal killer, the headset could have been better, 5w charger - but then again i need to charge only at night after a whole day of being on zoom calls - battery still at 30-40 percent capacity. My previous phone would go down to 10 percent in less than 4 hours.If you are looking for value for money, Android One phone then this is a better option. It's Made in India too!"
"  I am owning different models from Nokia like 7 plus nokia 8.1 and 5.1 plus. I had the issue with charging port for nokia 8.1 which was out of warranty still got covered in warranty for this. The service which we would come to expect from Nokia from old days is still there.And for the Nokia 5.3, I bought this for my mother and to tell in short the phone is very reliable, this phone is for those who expect a reliable phone which will last you more and have covered all the necessary features, have top notch built quality. The phone is not for the gaming enthusiast."
"  Firstly its stock Android and no bugs like other mobiles.. genuine security and software updates on monthly or timely basis.Then comes nokia build quality..for the price it could have been an aluminium block rather mix up..yet it's fine.. superb processor and Ram always choose high end variant..No lags on the screen and too good for murli tasking..yet it's bigger in size and careful while handling..4000mah Battery is lasting 2 days on a hectic days so normally it can last longer..Camera could have been more premium, if ur looking or purchasing only on the basis of camera don't go for this.. it's specifically not designed for camera experience I guess."
"  Camera and screen quality is not good, Phone is too slow not like 4 GB RAM, battery life is average, No twin app feature, no app lock, no gallery app ( only google photos), Only design and looks good, build quality is good. But no features not worth for 13999.Also when i delivered the item package was very bad condition and one side seal is opened and found that mobile is taken out by bending box and pulling the plastic cover wrap on the mobile and returned back to box with out tampering the box. No smell of new device. Old unsold item. Very bad seller, do not purchase from this seller."
  Phone is Decent for professional use...exceeds expectations ...Much better than Chinese phonesCamera quality  =GoodBattery = Excellentcalling and reception = excellentRam management = excellentBuild = Decent0 bloatwareNo heating issueUsed with 44-50 apps ram management is DecentAnd phone is faster than samsung. Exynos  9611 devicesOnly disappointment is headset ...which is made in china....else Phone is quite Decent pick and  satisfactory to BrandGaming =Not triedLast but not least Sound quality and Equalizer work perfectly...sound quality is best.
"  I got the phone withing 3 days. All safe and sound. Good packaging.Contents-Phone,10W charger,basic nokia headset,transparent backcoverMy first impression - the moment I took the phone out of the plastic case I was literally like 'WOW'.All my doubts went puff.Design-10/10Build quality- Do I even have to say it? 11/10I got a lot of questions from people around me like why did you go for nokia. You could have bought anything else. HONESTLY, I had to convince myself to go for this (With a tiny bit of effort from my bf).I had considered buying samsung's M21s M31s Or M51. Sure it had much better specs on paper But I was not so sure about its build quality. Now, I'm pretty sure my phone could stand wear and tear of my regular rough use much more than any other competition in the market with no compromise on the looks.Now let me tell you, I'll be getting 2 years of assured Android upgrade. Means I'll never be outdated in the OS section.It took 8 hours of movies songs and browsing to bring the battery from 100-0With normal usage it lasted 12-13 hours easily.Fingerprint scanner I found a bit glitchy.Face recognition is actually good. (3-4s delay)The powerbutton notification light is glamorous 😁Camera-8/10 I'm no wildlife photographer. I found its okay for regular use. Means if you are not into all the techie reviews you get on phone camera these days, its a decent camera.I found no lag switching btw apps. I opened multiple apps simultaneously had no issues whatsoever.Haven't tried gaming(not my purpose)Sound quality is good. Display is good.One more thing No Bloatwares.. I was so stocked for stock Android considering my prev phone was redmi. 😜To sum up I don't get all the negative review that this phone gets. I'm so in love with this phone.No regrets whatsoever."
"  Nokia has its brand and that’s the reason for this price. Quality of the product is sturdy and sure to run for years from now. Of course., this comes with Google’s native android OS which ensures better security and promising updates. But there are few cons for this price -1. Screen Quality is not so great, the HD contents even played have no great viewing experience.2. The sound goes sometime dead. You need to restart the mobile to get back to normal.3. Camera is not so great... Overall it is 13+5+2+2 => I know this range is very but I presumed the quality will match up to some extent with what an iPhone’s minimalistic configuration does., but that was a huge disappointment.4. Battery is just ok.., Not so great when the phone is used continuously for hours.Overall the price of this product can be at a range of ₹.10.5K for 4 GB and ₹.12K for 6 GB, that too this range only for the brand called NOKIA..!"
  Very bad quality phone... Never ever buy... Always hang... Sick of it in 8 days... Want to return to Amazon
"  Finally I got Nokia 5.3 ..an exceptional device at this price range. The display is vibrant in color & contrast, sharp text. In hand feeling is awesome. Call quality is also great .Camera fantastic. Device experience same as what Nokia advertised. Solid material and far better than Samsung and all other low cost high production Chinese  devices ."
"  An absolute trash of a phone. Don't waste your money on it. I regret not buying a Samsung instead.The main problem for me is that the screen goes completely black while making a call and even when you answer an incoming call. Power or volume button doesn't help. The screen comes back on only when the call ends.I updated the phone's sytem too but it still didn't help.Apparently, this problem is common across most nokia phones. Should have known that earlier.Even apart from this, the phone is quite average. The camera is okay at this price range. Battery life is fine too. I'm not a fan of this pure android though. The screen problem is a major red flag. Other brands offer way better phones at a lesser price."
  Mobile is worth in this budget. Good look and attractive design.
  Awesome phone... And what more you need it's NOKIA.... Display would had been more better... Rest all good so far.... Will add more review after daily use...
  Good but mobile charger not good
"  I purchased a brand new model Nokia 5.3 around 2 weeks ago & I started to face the Proximity Sensor problem a few days ago. I contacted the Online support, I contacted the Authorized Nokia Customer customer care & I got to know even they couldn't fix this. I heard it can only be repaired and not replaced. I mean who will be ready to get their brand new mobile phone opened and repaired right after 2 weeks of purchase and not replaced? I got to know that gives Replacement warranty only for 7/10 days from the date of purchase. So technically says they take responsibility on their products only for the 1st 7-10 days. Technically after that, it is not their headache. Nokia was a game-changer in the last decade and now its game is changing in the market against other competitors coz of this company policy. I would not appreciate this policy of the company of not replacing the mobile if it had the issue coming from the Company. I have used since the 3310 model till 5800 express music and I always loved to use this brand coz of its durability which is a big question in today's models. What an irony isn't it??  I would strongly not recommend to anyone to purchase mobile phones when we do not get a promising warranty from the company where we get the same replacement warranty from other mobile brands. I definitely need a Replacement for my purchase and not a repair from. This mobile was the First gift to my Father-In-Law & for sure made it more memorable or I would say ""Miserable"". I would really want to bring this into your notice. These little things will surely help the bring back their charm in India's market."
"  A software experience non-chinese phone! If you want a phone only for the sake of software with zero bloatware and latest Android updates then go for it.Pros :1. Android one (zero trash apps)2. Build quality is good, only looks premium.3. Call quality is good, WiFi calling feature is added.4. Total control over any apps that you install.5. 2 years Android upgrades. (September 1 security patch out of the box)Cons :1. Weight distribution of this phone is not equal, can't text with one hand for more than 10minutes.2. Camera/Video quality sucks.3. Nokia claims to give 2-day battery life but it doesn't last even till evening.4. Phone lags sometimes during switching apps, specially during phone calls I found out.5. The charger is only 10W so it takes much time to go from 20% to 100% (i.e >2hours)Lastly the price should have been around 11k-12k."
"  The Mobile speaker is having a problem, I can listen clearly while others are talking but they are not able to listen to what I am talking about. Call is also getting disconnecting very frequently.This is the really bad experience about this phone and i am still waiting for product to replace.No value for money, spent huge amount and not able to use the phone at all.."
  I regret buying this stupid phone. Everybody told me to buy samsung but I gave nokia a chance. Camera is okay. Main reason we changed was that our samsung j was too slow. Nokia is not that fast phone. You cant even record the call without an alert for both parties. It doesnt even have a calculator or gallery. And the google assistant is too annoying. I wont recommend. For this features its heavily priced.
  I have used it since last 4 days and I am writing about its performance as I experienced.1) It is simply the best comparing all popular china products within this range.2) Its battery backup is simply superb.3) Its screen resolution is okkay. But it can be improved as we deserve it from HMD global.4) Smooth operation with minimum uses of battery.
"  Don't buy this phone by just looking at specs and thinking it's Nokia so quality would be good.This phone is below average with current market standards for camera, screen, performance. Build quality is very cheap. It's a big mistake to spend 15 k for this phone😓"
  if there is less than one star I will give that toothe worest phone.trust me please don't buy this. I was crying after buying this mobile. getting that much irritating while using this mobile
"  WISH I COULD GIVE A GREAT REVIEW. WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THE PHONE.UNFORTUNATELY THE PHONE TURNED OUT TO BE FAULTY. DESPITE 4 HOURS OF EXCELLENT INTERNET SPEED, THE SOFTWARE UPDATE DID NOT GET INSTALLED.THE AMAZON TECHNICAL TEAM WAS ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT. DIDN'T KNOW THAT IF THE PHONE IS FAULTY, INSTEAD OF GETTING REPLACEMENT/ RETURN/ REFUND, THE TECHNICAL TEAM WILL ACCESS AND THEN COME TO A CONCLUSION. NO ASSURANCE FROM THE TECHNICAL TEAM THAT IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTS BEFORE THE RETURN WINDOW, YOU WILL GET REPLACEMENT. RETURN IS DEEMED TO BE GIVEN BASED ON THE TECHNICIAN MOOD SWINGS. NO CONFIRMATION IF THE TECHNICIAN HAS IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF ANDROID DEVICES.FELT AS IF THEY WERE MAKING ME OUT TO BE A LIAR, BECAUSE I COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FAULT.NO REGARD FOR OUR HARD EARNED MONEY. NO REGARD FOR BEING A PRIME MEMBER.PLEASE CONFIRM THE RETURN POLICY FOR ANY ELECTRONIC ITEMS BEFORE PURCHASING THEM ON AMAZON.EXTREMELY AND UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED AND DISSATISFIED."
"  Awesome buy..got it last week. I'm impressed by the overall experience this phone offered. Love the Android One experience.. absolutely no spam apps..justbthe way I like. Camera can be better, but that's not something that was very important for me anyway. The processor is able to handle multiple apps and switching quickly between them. Good battery life, maybe need a slightly larger capacity bty. Loved the Google assistant button too. Bought the black one, seeing brown and cyan also available now...wasn't when I bought it."
  Hardly 15 days into using the phone and this happens to the screen. Pathetic. What a waste of money!
"  This phone is good at1) Pure, bloatware-free Android. Two years of Android upgrades and three years of security updates is a bliss. You'll start to realize the value of software updates after a year.2) Build Quality. Feels Premium in Hand.3) Battery Life. Easy 2 days of time for 2-3 hours SOT per day.The display is not as bad as I thought it was. I've used a phone with an FHD display, and honestly, there is no noticeable difference between the HD+ Display and FHD Display.The Camera is OKish. Not as good as compared to 64MP Cameras that are available for the same price point. Stock Camera App works well compared to GCam on Rear Camera, and GCam works well compared to the Stock Camera App on the selfie camera. So using two apps for two cameras.If you want to buy a phone and forget about it for 3-4 years, this is the one. You get Software updates, so it is not outdated. Bcz after 2 years, you wouldn't care if it has 730g or 665, you would want android 12 with security updates.The Bottomline is, this phone is an excellent daily driver. Will never let you down."
"  First impressions- Very good screen resolution. Nice video streaming and good audio. Calls, user interface is also very good. Impressive battery life!Like the feel of it. Happy to use trusted brand Nokia. Replaced OnePlus 6 + with this.Quiet pleased and thinking that whether there is any need for high end phones when one have good features at less than fifteen k!"
"  The device didn't support any sim. It came with corrupted IMEI. The replacement is also not instant. If you are gifting it to someone, the person will be in trouble. Sad to get such a poor service."
  Display is pretty good.Camera is ok.Battery lasts a day with moderate usage.Adv: two year+ android updateConsider Nokia before buying Xiaomi/Oppo/Realme/Poco etc.
"  Phone lags, less battery power, low camera, slow charging, bad phone resolution , costlyBuy only if you need regular software updates"
"  Worst device. Just after 7 days I started having problem with calls. Every call connects after 10 seconds. When I connect ear phone, loudspeaker turns on which cannot be turned off. On payment apps unable to enter pin. Cannot even return the device as Return policy is only for week. Don't go for this device."
"  5th October 2020 purchased Nokia 5.3 thinking that Nokia 5.3 will be a very good phone, but it is totally waste. I was using the fitness band and connected through the bluetooth through the phone. From the day one i am facing the issue on the connectivity. Once pair the device, it will get connected for some time and later it is not getting connected. Blurtooth connectivity is the major issue in this phone. I have contacted the nokia chat support and followed the instructions to resolve the issue and it is not resolved. It is frustrating."
"  All of u note that in this phone we cant install dual clone apps.... major disappointment.In youtube found two optionsOpt1. multiple user/work profile option, but everytime we need to change user to see the clone appNot usefulOpt 2. Install a 3rd party app ( which has many ads and not reliable) to install and use clone/dual appNokia do something to support at lease whatsup clone app..."
  I have used this phone for around 3 months the major issue is proximity sensor does not work which is irritating during calls as screen goes black during call and tap even does not make display on.Nokia failed again dont buy this brand they are not fixing major issues
