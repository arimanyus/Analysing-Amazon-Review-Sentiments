# Sentiment Analyzer for Amazon Reviews

I was initially making this project by myself, but hopefully with open-sourcing we can take this forward. The idea is pretty simple - fetch Amazon reviews of selected products and analyze the sentiments of those reviews.

## Getting started
* Fork this repository (Click the Fork button at the top right of this page)
* Clone your forked repository to your local machine. 

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/Analysing-Amazon-Review-Sentiments.git
```

* Create a branch

```markdown
git checkout -b branch-name
```

* Make your changes (choose from any task mentioned above)
* Commit and push

```markdown
git add .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push origin branch-name
```

* Create a new pull request from your forked repository (Click the `New Pull Request` button located at the top of your repo)
* Wait for your PR review and merge approval!
* __Star this repository__ if you had fun!

## ToDo
* Create the actual analyzer. Please discuss the algorithm and approach you're using before making PR.
